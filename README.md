# Mr-Smith-Chrome-Extension-SJA
A simple Chrome extension which plays the Mr Smith fanfare and plays a video of his animation. Mr Smith from Sarah Jane Adventures &amp; Doctor Who.

It plays a fanfare when you open it up and starts playing the Series 1 animation by default. You can then choose to change the video to show the Series 2 onwards fluid animation, but this isn't a setting that will be saved next time. 

If you want to try the extension for yourself, simply download the folder "mr_smith_extension" to your machine.
Then in Chrome, go to the extensions page or just type "chrome://extensions" in the URL. Then turn on Developer mode. 
Then simply click "Load Unpacked Extension" and select the mr_smith_extension folder. 
You should be good to go.
